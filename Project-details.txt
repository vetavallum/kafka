Database side
1. Cassandra:
	- On Cassandra side, I created a keyspace edureka and a table productlist inside edureka
	- bin/cqlsh 192.168.99.101
	- CREATE KEYSPACE edureka WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};
	- use edureka;
	- CREATE TABLE productlist (
		pogId text,
		supC text,
		brand text,
		description text,
		size text,
		category text,
		subCategory text,
		country text,
		sellerCode text,
		PRIMARY KEY((pogId, supC),category )
		);
2. MySQL:
	- On MySQL side, I created a database edureka and a table productlist inside edureka
	- service mysqld start
	- mysql -u root -p
	- use edureka;
	- CREATE TABLE productlist (
		pogId varchar(255),
		supC varchar(255),
		price float,
		quantity int
		);

Used eclipse and created 3 projects in eclipse for this assignment

1. CassandraMySQLWrite
This project has 2 JAVA files

1a. ProductModelNew.java
	- This is the class that has all attributes mentioned in the requirement
	
1b. AsynchronousProductProducer.java 
	- This is the asynchronous producer of kafka
	- It reads the file from C:\\src\\products.csv
	- Reads line by line and Splits by comma
	- Creates a ProductModelNew object
	- Converts to a Json string and produces to the topic(productlisttopic) till the end of the file

2. CassandraMySQLConsumer
This project has 3 JAVA files

2a. ProductModel.java
	- Exactly same Product Model with just a different class name
	- Same as ProductModelNew.java
	
2a. CassandraConnector.java
	- helps to connect to the cluster
	
2c. WriteToCassandra.java
	- It is one of the consumer of kafka and subscribes to topic(productlisttopic)
	- It is part of consumer group grp-1
	- polls the record and converts the record to ProductModel object
	- It then calls the CassandraConnector class and connects to cassandra cluster
	- INSERT INTO edureka.productlist

3. MySQLConsumer
This project has 2 JAVA files

3a. ProductModelMySQL.java
	- Exactly same Product Model with just a different class name
	- Same as ProductModelNew.java
	
3b. SimpleMySQLConsumer.java
	- It is one of the consumer of kafka and subscribes to topic(productlisttopic)
	- It is part of consumer group grp-2
	- polls the record and converts the record to ProductModel object
	- uses jdbc:mysql://192.168.99.101:3306/edureka to connect to MySQL
	- INSERT INTO productlist
